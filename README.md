# _Yomi (黄泉)_

based on [everything-nix](https://github.com/prescientmoon/everything-nix). 

In case you are not familiar with nix/nixos, this is a collection of configuration files which build all my systems in a declarative manner. The tool used to configure the global system is called [nixos](https://nixos.org/), and the one used to configure the individual users is called [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).

> A [visual history](./docs/history.md) of my setup is in the works!

## Features this repository includes:

- Sets up all the apps I use — including git, neovim, fish, tmux, starship, hyprland, anyrun, discord, zathura, foot & much more.
- Sets up my entire homelab — including zfs-based [impermanence](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings), automatic let's-encrypt certificates, tailscale, syncthing, vaultwarden, whoogle, pounce, calico, smos, intray, actual & more.
- Consistent base16 theming using [stylix](https://github.com/danth/stylix)
- Declarative secret management using [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix)

## Hosts

This repo's structure is based on the concept of hosts - individual machines configured by me. I'm naming each host based on things in space/mythology (_they are the same picture_). The hosts I have right now are:

- [amaterasu](./hosts/nixos/amaterasu/) — my personal laptop
- [tsukuyomi](./hosts/nixos/tsukuyomi/) — my tower pc
- susanoo — my android phone. Although not configured using nix, this name gets referenced in some places
