## Adding Documentation

### Adding Features

Edit `content/docs/features.yaml`:

```yaml
features:
  - title: New Feature Category
    description: Description of the feature set
    items:
      - feature one
      - feature two
      - feature three
```

### Updating Pricing

Edit `content/docs/pricing.yaml`:

```yaml
summary:
  total_monthly: 2.50
  currency: EUR

subscriptions:
  - name: NewService
    description: Service description
    annual_cost: 30
    url: https://example.com/
```

### Managing TODOs

Edit `content/docs/todo.yaml`:

```yaml
tasks:
  - title: New task to complete
    completed: false
    priority: high  # high, medium, or low
    
  - title: Completed task
    completed: true
    priority: medium
```

## Validation

After making changes, validate your content:

```bash
# Using the justfile
just validate-content

# Or directly with Python
python3 scripts/validate-content.py

# Or using yamllint (if installed)
yamllint content/
```

## Common Patterns

### Marking Services as Disabled

Don't delete services you're not using - mark them as disabled:

```yaml
- name: ServiceName
  description: service description
  url: https://example.com
  category: other
  enabled: false  # ‚Üê Marked as disabled
  notes: Disabled because...
```

### Adding Notes

Use the `notes` field for important context:

```yaml
- name: Whoogle
  description: search engine
  url: https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search
  category: search-engine
  enabled: false
  notes: "OR SearXNG - switching between search engines"
```

### Referencing Configuration Files

For tools with config files, link to them:

```yaml
- name: Neovim
  description: my editor
  url: https://neovim.io/
  category: editor
  config_path: ./home/features/neovim/default.nix
```

## Tips

1. **Be consistent**: Follow existing formatting patterns
2. **Validate early**: Check your YAML before committing
3. **Add URLs**: Help others discover the tools/services
4. **Use categories**: Choose the most appropriate category
5. **Document reasons**: Use `notes` to explain decisions
6. **Keep it simple**: Don't over-complicate entries
