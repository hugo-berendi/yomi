# Yomi Project State

## Recently Completed: Home Assistant Volkswagen We Connect ID Integration Fix

### What We Did
- Diagnosed Home Assistant error logs showing `No module named 'weconnect'` error for the `volkswagen_we_connect_id` custom integration
- Located the Home Assistant configuration at `/home/hugob/projects/yomi/hosts/nixos/inari/services/home-assistant.nix`
- Checked the integration's manifest.json which showed requirements: `weconnect==0.60.8` and `ascii_magic>=2.0.0`
- Added missing Python dependencies to the `extraPackages` section in home-assistant.nix:
  - `weconnect`
  - `ascii-magic`
- Successfully built the NixOS configuration with the new dependencies

### Files Modified
- `/home/hugob/projects/yomi/hosts/nixos/inari/services/home-assistant.nix` (lines 37-41) - Added weconnect and ascii-magic to extraPackages

### What Needs to Be Done Next
1. Apply the configuration on the inari host with `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`
2. Restart Home Assistant service to pick up the new dependencies
3. Verify the integration loads without errors in the logs
4. Test the Volkswagen We Connect ID integration functionality

### Notes
- The integration is v0.2.6 from GitHub (mitch-dc/volkswagen_we_connect_id)
- The fix involved adding the Python dependencies that the custom component requires
- Build completed successfully, ready for deployment
