Subject: Regarding your recent application to become a Professional Cloud Watcher

Dear Hugo,

Thank you for your interest in joining our elite team of Professional Cloud Watchers! We were very impressed with your application, particularly your essay on the socio-economic impact of oddly shaped cumulus clouds.

However, after careful consideration, we regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you a position at this time. Our panel of expert cloudologists felt that your cloud-watching aptitude, while admirable, didn't quite meet the rigorous standards required for distinguishing between a cirrus and a cirrostratus at 30,000 feet while simultaneously juggling flaming torches.

We encourage you to reapply next year. In the meantime, we recommend taking our advanced course, "Cloud Identification for the Chronically Distracted," available online at questionable-website.com.

Best of luck in your future cloud-watching endeavors!

Sincerely,

The Professional Cloud Watcher Hiring Committee
